# Evolution Presentation CRA

This repository accompanies [The Evolution of Design And Development - A Melting Pot](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/evolution-in-design-and-development), my presentation for React Camp at Open Camps NYC November 18, 2017, entitled Evolution of Design and Development: A Melting Pot. This, and the repository [Evolution Design Dev Sass](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/evolution-design-dev-sass), made up the workshop that accompanied that presentation.
