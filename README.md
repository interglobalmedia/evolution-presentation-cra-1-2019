# Evolution Presentation CRA

This repository accompanies [The Evolution of Design And Development - A Melting Pot](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/evolution-in-design-and-development), my presentation for React Camp at Open Camps NYC November 18, 2017, entitled Evolution of Design and Development: A Melting Pot. This, and the repository [Evolution Design Dev Sass](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/evolution-design-dev-sass), made up the workshop that accompanied that presentation.

This part of the workshop is meant for implementing `CSS Modules` in a `React application` and using `Create React App`. As of `version 2.0` (this is running on `version 2.1.3` on January 24, 2019), `CSS Modules` AND `Sass` are ***supported*** **out of the box**. So no ejecting out of CRA necessary!

Please first visit [The Evolution of Design And Development - A Melting Pot](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/evolution-in-design-and-development), click on the link to the live site, and follow the instructions in the presentation itself. Have fun!
